				    	<img alt="About Global Women In Technology" src="images/CONTENT-about.jpg" id="phone"/>
				    	<p class="grey">Global Women in Technology was born to address several needs from various parts of the world. Globalization and automation are rapidly changing the economics of the world and the nature of its workforce. There is a greater demand for those studying Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) as technical jobs grow in number. In the U.S. there is a shortage of young people studying STEM, and those who do are predominantly men. Recent data from the U.S. Department of Commerce shows that fewer than 25% of all jobs in STEM are held by women despite the fact that women in STEM earn 33% more, on average, than women not working in STEM.</p>
				    	<p class="grey">In this same report, the U.S. Department of Commerce cites “a lack of female role models” as its first possible factor that contributes to this gender discrepancy. The US is generally dominated by female role models from the music, fashion, and entertainment industries, which helps reinforce a culture in which women avoid STEM. However, this cultural bias does not exist in many other countries around the world; instead, cultural norms are such that many more women study STEM. Global Women in Technology aims to provide young women in the U.S. with alternative role models in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. We hope that these women can supplant Hollywood actresses and athletes as idols for young girls.</p>
				    	<p class="grey">At the same time, many women around the world do not enjoy the career and personal opportunities that women have in the United States, especially in the Bay Area. In other parts of the world, risk-taking and entrepreneurship are often discouraged, and there is often a lack of investment capital. The opposite is true of the Silicon Valley, where investment capital is plentiful and entrepreneurship is encouraged. Developing a network and receiving an education in entrepreneurship within Silicon Valley could be a powerful enabler for women around the world to make an impact.</p>
				    	<p class="grey">Our Silicon Valley Internship Program, in conjunction with our Mentorship Program, addresses both of these needs by brining female role models from other countries to Silicon Valley for a 10-week summer internship and entrepreneurship program, and then matches these women leaders with young female students in the U.S.</p>
				    	<p class="grey">We believe this furthers our goals of empowering women everywhere, and advancing the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. </p>
